Pester-Demo

Working through VS CODE + INTEGRATED CONSOLE + PESTER = NO EXCUSE TESTING from Nick Hudacin
Following up on an earlier post where I lightly touch on using the PowerShell Extension for the VS Code editor, I’d love to share how easy it is to Pester test and hopefully convince you to start testing your code today! If you’re not familiar with me, I’m a huge fan of Pester. I mean this is such a great module that it’s baked into Windows! I Pester test EVERYTHING. Even things outside of my custom PowerShell functions… ETL executions, Jenkins job statuses, all kinds of things. I did a post about Pester testing SQL Server stuff, check it out if you haven’t seen it!

Using VS Code and the PowerShell extension, writing Pester tests has never been easier!!
